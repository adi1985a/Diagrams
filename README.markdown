## API Diagram

The API serves as the backbone of the project, connecting the client side with the server side. It handles data requests, processing, and returns appropriate responses. Below is the diagram outlining the structure and flow of the API.

### API Overview

- **Endpoints**: The API consists of multiple RESTful endpoints for data retrieval, updates, and actions.
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication (JWT) is used to secure the API.
- **Request/Response**: The API follows a structured JSON format for both requests and responses.
