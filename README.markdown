## 🛰️ API Diagram

The API serves as the backbone of the project, connecting the client side with the server side. It handles data requests, processing, and returns appropriate responses.

### 🔹 API Overview

- **Endpoints**: Multiple RESTful endpoints for data retrieval, updates, and user actions.
- **Authentication**: Secured via **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
- **Data Format**: Structured **JSON** format for both requests and responses.
- **Error Handling**: Returns standardized HTTP status codes with detailed error messages.

## 🏗️ App Architecture

The overall application follows a modular and scalable structure, separating concerns across services and domains.

- Follows **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** or **MVVM** pattern.
- Services are loosely coupled for scalability and maintainability.
- Error handling and logging are centralized.

## 📱 Mobile App Architecture

The mobile application is built using platform-specific or cross-platform frameworks with a clean separation of UI, logic, and services.

- **State Management**: Using Provider, Bloc, or Redux (depending on framework).
- **Data Layer**: Handles API communication and local caching.
- **Navigation**: Handled via routing system for seamless screen transitions.

## 🖥️ Presentation

The presentation layer is responsible for user interaction, component rendering, and form input validation.

- Designed using **component-based UI frameworks** (e.g., React, Flutter, SwiftUI).
- Supports **internationalization (i18n)** and accessibility.
- UI follows responsive and adaptive design for cross-device compatibility.

## 🗃️ Database

The database is optimized for performance and scalability.

- **Type**: SQL / NoSQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Entities**: Users, Sessions, Transactions, Logs, etc.
- **Indexes**: Applied to critical columns to optimize read speed.
- **Security**: Enforced via access rules and encryption of sensitive fields.
